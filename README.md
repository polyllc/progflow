# progflow
scripting for efficiency

# important notice!

this is a program in production, most of the features have not been implemented! I'm only making this public to see if anyone is interested in helping out, and also mainly for a different program that I need this to be public for :). 

#hopeful features (to implement)
- conditional statements
- i/o with files
- loops
- arithmetic
- regex
- maybe functions
- anything you want to implement

#purpose
I've always wanted to make a programming language, so why not start out with a scripting language which is much easier to make. This program is meant for a replacement for applets or scripts or whatever you want to call them, like my ffmpeg programs. I guess you could also call this a "replacement" for shell, but nothing can really replace that, right?

#contributing!
If you're thinking about contributing (doesn't have to be a big contribution at all!), fork this repository, edit it all you want, and then submit a pull request. I'll look it over and hopefully (most definitely) merge it with the main branch! Just here are some tips:
- try and keep the code neat
- comments!
- if you're changing fundamental pieces of code, make sure they work throughout and they work better than the previous implementation (even if it might be a bit slower in implementation, if it's easier to implement into the code for readability and such, that also works!)
- don't worry about how big or small your change is!

#progflow file
There's a progflow file included to show how the progflow language looks like with all the functions and capabilities that it should have, please go by this format, or not! It doesn't matter, just don't stray too too far away from this format


# building
- linux
  - `g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp` or `g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp`
- windows
  - use progflow.sln in visual studio and build
